# Welcome To My GitHub !!!
## About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Ira Samant, A Data Science student at UNC Charlotte, with a minor in Actuarial Mathematics. Iâ€™m passionate about using data to uncover insights, build ethical models, and drive impact across areas like finance, food access, and education.
I enjoy working on projects that blend machine learning, social good, and fairness in AI. Whether itâ€™s building a logistic regression model to predict food insecurity or designing decision tree classifiers to detect unethical behavior, I focus on creating work thatâ€™s both technically sound and ethically thoughtful.

## ðŸ’¼ Key Projects 
**Predictive Modeling of Emergency Food Gaps in NYC**

**Explore the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/irasamant21/Food-Gap-Regression)**

Built a logistic regression model to identify NYC neighborhoods at risk of food insecurity during crises. Used real-world open data, applied data cleaning, EDA, and evaluated the model with precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tech Used: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn

**Streaming Analytics: Global Movies & TV Trends**

**View the dashboard project on [GitHub](https://github.com/irasamant21/gdp-dashboard-movie-data)**

Scraped Box Office Mojo data to analyze global movie earnings. Built a Tableau dashboard and created a Streamlit app integrating TV and film analytics to guide content strategies.
Tech Used: Python (web scraping), Streamlit, Tableau

Break Through Tech AI Studio Capstone (In Progress)

Currently preparing for an applied AI capstone project in the fall as part of Cornell Techâ€™s year-long AI Studio Fellowship. Will collaborate with industry partners like Google and Microsoft on a real-world machine learning problem with ethical impact.

Planned Focus: NLP, fairness, model deployment
