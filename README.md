# Welcome To My GitHub !!!
## About Me üëã

Hi, I‚Äôm Ira Samant, A Data Science student at UNC Charlotte, with a minor in Actuarial Mathematics. I‚Äôm passionate about using data to uncover insights, build ethical models, and drive impact across areas like finance, food access, and education.
I enjoy working on projects that blend machine learning, social good, and fairness in AI. Whether it‚Äôs building a logistic regression model to predict food insecurity or designing decision tree classifiers to detect unethical behavior, I focus on creating work that‚Äôs both technically sound and ethically thoughtful.

## Tech Stack
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
## Languages
**1. Python:** Used in nearly all data science and machine learning projects, including logistic regression for food gap prediction and neural networks in Break Through Tech‚Äôs AI program ***
**2. Java:** Implemented maze traversal algorithms and simulation-based projects in Data Structures & Algorithms ***
**3. SQL:** Applied in structured data queries and database-driven exercises
**4. SAS:** Used in regression analysis and statistical modeling during coursework in resource allocation and prediction***
**5. HTML:** Used to support frontend integration of dashboards (e.g., Streamlit/Tableau embedding)***

## Data Science & Machine Learning
**1. Pandas & NumPy:** Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis in multiple projects
**2. scikit-learn:** Model building, including logistic regression, decision trees, evaluation (F1-score, precision, recall)
**3. TensorFlow:** Implemented neural network models in Break Through Tech coursework
**4. Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Early work through ML labs at Cornell Tech‚Äôs AI Studio

## Data Visualization & Dashboards
**1. Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Visualized model results and trends in academic and project-based work
**2. Tableau:** Built global movie/TV analytics dashboards using scraped data
**3. Streamlit:** Developed interactive web apps for model outputs and dashboard visualizations (e.g., food gap & TV data)

## Key Projects 
**Predictive Modeling of Emergency Food Gaps in NYC**

**Explore the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/irasamant21/Food-Gap-Regression)**

Built a logistic regression model to identify NYC neighborhoods at risk of food insecurity during crises. Used real-world open data, applied data cleaning, EDA, and evaluated the model with precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tech Used: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn

**Streaming Analytics: Global Movies & TV Trends**

**View the dashboard project on [GitHub](https://github.com/irasamant21/gdp-dashboard-movie-data)**

Scraped Box Office Mojo data to analyze global movie earnings. Built a Tableau dashboard and created a Streamlit app integrating TV and film analytics to guide content strategies.
Tech Used: Python (web scraping), Streamlit, Tableau

Break Through Tech AI Studio Capstone (In Progress)

Currently preparing for an applied AI capstone project in the fall as part of Cornell Tech‚Äôs year-long AI Studio Fellowship. Will collaborate with industry partners like Google and Microsoft on a real-world machine learning problem with ethical impact.

Planned Focus: NLP, fairness, model deployment

## Interests and Hobbies 
1.** Cricket** ‚Äî Avid player and fan, enjoy the strategy and teamwork of the game

2. **Horseback Riding** ‚Äî Passionate about riding and spending time outdoors with horses

3. **Hiking & Nature** ‚Äî Love exploring trails and connecting with nature on hikes
